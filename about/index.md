My name is Sébastien Attia and I am a Software Developer since 2000.

My core skill sets are Software Engineering and Machine Learning.
One of my greatest strengths is my ability to analyse a problem, break it down in parts and understand those parts.
Because I believe that people must be free from boring and repetitive tasks, I help companies deploy Software and Machine Learning anywhere it can help.

I have an [experience of +15 years](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sattia/) in the banking area.
Even if I were very lucky and I had the opportunity to work on exciting projects during these 15 years, I look for new challenges.

I started indeed my career as Software Engineer in 2000, at Cedel - becoming Clearstream few years later, a major Luxembourgish bank.
Since 2011, and after an amazing experience of 11 years at Clearstream, I started a new career as a freelance software developer.
I had the opportunity to have missions for Société General Corporate & Investment Banking, Paris, Banque Lombard-Odier, Geneva and a commodities trading company in Geneva.

After following the great [Machine Learning's course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) of Professor Ng, Stanford, on Coursera, I decided to add Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to my technical stack. I first followed this course by curiosity and to understand what were behind the buzzword "Machine Learning".

To keep track of my journey, I write Notes on what I am learning in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics and Programming. I publish these Notes and this is the purpose of this website.
