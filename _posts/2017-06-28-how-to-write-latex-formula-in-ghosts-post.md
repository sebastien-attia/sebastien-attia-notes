## Or how integrate MathJax into Ghost's posts ?

Ghost is my favourite editor to write posts, but it is not possible to write LaTex formula natively.
And my favourite editor to write LaTex formula is Jupyter.

__How integrate the work done in Jupyter into a Ghost's post ?__

Here is my solution:

* if your post has images, first upload the images into your Ghost's blog:
in your fresh "New Post", enter `![]()` to upload an image.
You will see the path where your Ghost instance stores the image.
Keep this path for later.
*See the [following post](https://help.ghost.org/hc/en-us/articles/223237408-Upload-Images) in the Ghost's help*

* go to you Jupyter Notebook and go to *"File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)"*; Jupyter will generate the HTML version of your Notebook.
You can now do a copy-paste of this HTML code into your Ghost's "New Post".

* the code generated by Jupyter is a full standalone HTML page; to make it work properly in Ghost, the following items must be removed:  
  * the doctype,  
  * the opening *html*,  
  * the opening and closing *head* tags,  
  * the *script* command to load jquery.min.js (already loaded by the page generated by Ghost),  
  * the opening *body* and *html*,  
  * the closing *body* and *html* tags,  
  * the spaces or tabs in front of the HTML *script* tag to load a JavaScript (in particular the *script* tag to load MathJax),
  * remove the very long long *style* tag generated by Jupyter,  

* search for the HTML's tag *img* and replace the path in `src` with the appropriate path obtained at the first point,

* move the *script* tags to the end of the page,

* finally, check the code generated by Ghost for this post, and see if it is a clean HTML page.

The [following post](https://notes.innovea.tech/cheat-sheet-on-neural-networks-1/) is an example of a Ghost's post created this way from the [following Notebook](https://github.com/sebastien-attia/MachineLearning/blob/master/blog/Cheat%20sheet%20on%20Neural%20Networks%201.ipynb).
